We thought it would be nice to see some new things today, so we got in the car and drove out the the Bluff Trail for a walk.

At 6:30 in the morning, it was a very pleasant place for an old man and his little dog.   We saw no dogs, but a few friendly bicyclists.   Among our sightings were  birds:

- red-winged blackbirds
- American crows
- Seagulls
- finches
- a pair of cranes heading to the Great Salt Lake

And other animals

- horses
- goats
- chickens (yeah I guess those belong in the bird category)

Bebop loved all the new sights and smells.   But she also learned about cheatgrass.  She collected some cheatgrass seeds in her harness and fur.  Then when it was bugging her, she rolled in the cheatgrass to rub it off.  Oops.  Bad idea.   We found a nice bench along the trail, where her partner (me!) spent five minutes picking it all out.

If you are not an outdoors-person of the arid West, here is your primer on cheatgrass (yuck):  [http://www.usu.edu/weeds/plant\_species/weedspecies/cheatgrass.html](http://www.usu.edu/weeds/plant_species/weedspecies/cheatgrass.html) .

A good time was had by all!

Update:   The possibility of infections in dogs from cheatgrass seeds embedding themselves is significant.   This article tells more:
