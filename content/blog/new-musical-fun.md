Once a barbershopper, always a barbershopper? It could be.

A new barbershop chorus formed in Davis County, Utah in 2014 ... but they forgot to let me know. Well ... I found them anyway, and I'm ready for some old fun repeated and some new fun with new friends.

The chorus is the [North Front Sound](http://www.northfrontsound.com/). You can visit their [website](http://www.northfrontsound.com/), or have a look on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/northfrontsound/info)

Last night was my first performance with them. We shared a venue at Northridge High School in Layton, UT. For me it brought back many fond memories, and it was just plain fun to be a part of an enthusiastic and talented chorus.
