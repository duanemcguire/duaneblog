This is not satire. One could only hope that some competition for broadband existed at this zipcode! (We had good service from Vivint for 6 years, before they left the neighborhood in May)

**Duane McGuire, upset customer. 1077 N 1285 W, Clinton, UTAH**

**We have had unreliable service for the entire duration of our account.**

**Downtime today has been 1 hour and 10 minutes. Ridiculous!**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Good evening.

**5 technicians have been out. Still isn't fixed. WHAT NEXT?**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

I am so sorry that you are experiencing internet issues with your internet connection. This is definitely not the experience we want for you. Let us go ahead and work further to resolve this

_While waiting, I wanted to share this since it is part of your XFINITY internet package. You can also connect to XFINITY WIFI public hotspot on the go for FREE. Just use your wifi capable devices and once you see XFINITYWIFI name connect to it using your XFINITY user name and password online. You can download the Xfinity app to check for hotspot location_  

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Thank you so much for waiting

**OK**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

I thoroughly checked everything in the account and there is no issues detected. There is also no reported internet outage in the area. When the internet goes out, does the modem light went off as well?

**Not always, no. But if the modem is restarted it will be out once restarted.**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

When you mentioned restarted, did you physically unplug and plug in the power cord or did it restart itself?

**unplug replug**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

I see. How are you connected to the internet? Is it thru wifi or hardwired connection using ethernet cord? We wanted to isolate the issue and determine what really causes this.

**O, My Goodness. From a server in texas I ping this modem every minute. 70 pings have failed today. While the pings are failing, NO device on the network has internet access. Surely you people keep notes. We have been through this SO MANY TIMES!**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

I am so sorry that you have to go through all these things. Here is what we can do:

**Yes?**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Since you are experiencing issue for several times and also have several technicians came out, I will submit report about this so our higher team will know and further investigate on the issue for complete resolution. Also, if it is fine with you, I can send another technician and this time, I will request for a supervisor tech. Will that be fine?

**That might help.**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Great!

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Please give me 2-3 minutes to complete the report and then will wait for the soonest available technician

**THanks.**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Also, we will process credit adjustments for the service interruptions

**Thanks.**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

You are welcome. I know where you are coming from. It is really essential to have stable and working internet nowadays specially working at home

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

I am still working on the account. Please bear with me

**OK The account does have some history!**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Yes. I was able to check the account notesI'm here again.

**I'm back, on my phone hotspot. Connection failed for a bit.**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Thank you so much for waiting

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Oh! I am so sorry about that. I was able to get available technician

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

**I'll be here. Thanks.**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Perfect!

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Is this your best call back number (801) 896-xxxx?

**Since techs have questioned the modem, It might be worthwhile for the tech to bring an Xfinity modem. If no other solution appears.**

**Yes 801-896-xxxx**

![](/images/icon-agent@2x.png)

Sure. I will definitely put that in the notes as well for the dispatched team reference and making sure they will review more/further investigate your issue prior to the visit

**Thanks.**
