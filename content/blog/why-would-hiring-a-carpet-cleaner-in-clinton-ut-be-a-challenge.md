**ACT I Brand X** I thought this was a recession! I thought that carpet cleaners would be begging for work! I called Brand X last week and scheduled today at 1 pm. At 1:30 it was a no show so I called to see if they were still coming. They said "Gee we don't have you on the schedule!" Needless to say, after spending hours moving furniture in preparation, I was a little disappointed. I expressed my dismay, and they said they'd have someone over at 5 pm. At 5:30 it was a no show, so I called to ask if they were still coming. The gal I talked to said "Gee I can't understand that. You're not on the schedule, and I remember talking to you earlier". Again (and I'll pat myself on the back for keeping my cool) I expressed my dismay.

**ACT II Simply Clean Carpet & Upholstery Care, Clearfield UT** After leaving the Brand X call, I started calling local Google listings for carpet cleaners. I connected with Stephen Galloway, owner of Simply Clean. I told him my story of woe. Steve had already done a day's work, and had just arrived home. But he said, "Gee do you have all that furniture moved? ... OK ... How about I come over and do the job in about 20 minutes?" 20 minutes later he was here setting up his equipment.

As you might assume, I'm writing this just because I believe folks who know how to provide good service should be rewarded. Well that's Stephen of Simply Clean Carpet & Upholstery Care. I was totally impressed with his service attitude, and as you might expect, the cleaning was top notch!

If you are in Davis County Utah ( Clinton, Clearfield, Syracuse, Layton, etc) I whole-heartedly recommend this company for your carpet cleaning needs!
