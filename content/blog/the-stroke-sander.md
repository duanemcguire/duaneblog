I bought the stroke sander several months ago from an out-of-business cabinet shop. This weekend when my daughter Erin came to town, we worked on a first class coffee table for her. It is built of 6/4 hardwood panels that we glued up. The largest of the panels is 28"X22". The stroke sander worked great for creating a smooth, flat surface. Also, I was pleased with the effectiveness of dust collection for this inherently messy machine! The videos shows Erin sanding one of the cherry panels.
