I work in wood.  But for years I've wanted to get into the machinist's world too.   A few months ago I "ran across" a 1950s  Craftsman/Atlas lathe that I couldn't resist.   Until last week it sat in the shop waiting for me.  Now after cleaning the lathe, doing minor repairs, watching hours of Youtube instructionals,  poring over old manuals, and buying doo-dads, I've completed my first project.  I'm pretty darned pleased.

It's a tool gizmo, recognizable to piano technicians.
