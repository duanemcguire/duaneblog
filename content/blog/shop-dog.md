Bebop has been with us for more than 6 months, now. Are we bonded? Oh yeah! She is constantly with one of us. When we are in the same room, it's an easy choice of where to be. Otherwise, she has preferences:

1. Kitchen: Well I guess that's obvious. It's where the food is.
2. Outside: That's where we play. That's the fun place. Unless it's too hot or too cold or too wet or the person there is not into fun!
3. Upstairs office: She has a nice bed there, and the people are friendly.
4. The shop: She has a nice bed there, too. When Duane is tuning, voicing, or playing a piano, it's a nice place to be.

While Terri was working outside today, it was too hot and Terri wasn't enough fun. So Bebop chose option four: shop dog.
