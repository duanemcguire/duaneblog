Our house was built 17 years ago. A look around the neighborhood will tell you that the roofing jobs were not the very best. We found that we were at the point of doing repairs which would probably continue annually. Since we plan to be here for many years, we decided on a new roof.

The McGuire heritage is one of get up and do it yourself. Well, not this job! My climbing days are over, and I was never really attracted to roofing. The roofing company I hired blew away all expectations; I had no idea that a crew could tear off the old and install a new roof in a day. But oh my, this crew can. Seven ninjas on the roof with a short lunch break, and it's done, just like the company owner told me. They were moving so fast we couldn't get an accurate count, but I think there were seven. Hats off to [CCR roofing.](https://www.ccrroofingexperts.com/) of Clearfield, Utah.

Remarkably, all that energy was contagious. I had a very productive day in the shop. I had plenty of breaks, and took a couple of walks with Bebop to give her a break from the stress. But honestly, I got twice the work done in the shop that I usually do. Good contagion.
