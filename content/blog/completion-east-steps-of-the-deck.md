It's done. Steps for the east side of the deck. The deck was completed 5 years ago. Pandemic = round-to-it. The deck and stairs are the hardwood, ipe. When looking for handrail, I didn't want to pay for shipping from Advantage Lumber, the supplier for the rest of the ipe. I opted for locally sourced mahogany. Nice stuff!

Ipe steps and posts. Mahogany railing.
