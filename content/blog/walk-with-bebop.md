I'm finally calling myself "retired", and we made a good decision. We acquired Bebop, the dog!

Bebop: February 15, 2020  (she was newborn on December 28, 2019

Bebop joined us in February, just before the Covid-19 pandemic started changing lives here.   It was in the njpg)

B time!   She is our constant companion and home entertainment package.

Terri has taken the lead in training both me and Bebop.  We are a great team!    At five months old, Bebop has acquired many good habits, but she has also taught us how to be dog owners.

In the past couple of weeks, I've adopted the routine of  a morning walk with Bebop.   She has liked it from the start, but as we jointly form the routine, she is in love with it.   After her morning yard duty at 6:30, I ask her if she wants to go for a walk, and usually the result is a whimper of joy!

Our  usual route is shown above.  It's all fun, and full of great things to smell, but the park is the best part!   A few days ago, though, I made a mistake.   Starting out on our street, I walked on the north side of the street, instead of the south!  It was upsetting to Bebop.  Even after turning north at the corner, she still was whiny.   She was upset at the park too, and we didn't complete our usual tour.   When we started for home, all was OK!  She just said, "Let's go!"  This is the dog, training me!  Since then we have started out on the south side of the street, and we like that!   That's what the books say:  routines are important!
