My morning walk often passes by [Steed Pond](http://www.standard.net/Environment/2015/07/28/Officials-work-to-keep-Steed-Pond-other-waters-healthy). It's a small bit of nature amidst my suburban neighborhood. This spring, I've taken to more walks, and I've been pleasantly surprised to see what's living there, or at least passing by for the catch of the day.

This morning four American White Pelicans were fishing there, along with a couple of Double Crested Cormorants and the usual ducks. The pelicans migrate to areas near Salt Lake each spring, and depart for southern destinations in the fall. In years past, I had been amazed to see them on the water at a golf course, but this week was the first sighting within a half mile of home.

I was pleased to see the pelicans, but had to wonder what they were finding to eat. A bit of Google research reveals that the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources annually stocks the pond with rainbow trout. It turns out they are a tasty treat for pelicans. And I don't think they are respecting the limit of 2 per day!

[DWR reports](https://dwrapps.utah.gov/fishstocking/Fish) that this year they've planted 2807 rainbow trout in Steed Pond. These trout have had an average length of 11 inches. Examining the bill of the pelicans, I'd say the trout are a right-sized snack. It's fun to watch them fishing.
