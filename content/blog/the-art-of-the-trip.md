Art of the trip - Friday 9/21/2018 at Twin Falls, Idaho. Well this was unexpected. We were supposed to be home on Thursday morning, but our truck expressed its age, and we spent a day and a half in Twin Falls while it was repaired. We were not to be out done by failed catalytic converters, and found that Twin Falls is an art mecca! Much of it thanks to Art Hoag, who created Mary Alice Park.
