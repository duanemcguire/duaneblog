Golf is a social sport. Course operators like to have foursomes on the course. It's the traditional number of golfers in a group, and probably maximizes revenue while minimizing congestion on the course. So if you are wanting to play a busy course and have a tee time for two, you can count on being paired with another twosome.  
  
What pair will you draw? The answer can determine how much you enjoy the game. Sunday, Terri and I were paired up with a fun couple, Norm and Carma King. As the play progressed, we learned tidbits of their thoughts on golf, and about their lives. They've been married for 40 years and golfing together for 6 years. I enjoyed the playful banter between them, and the easy way in which they played the game.  
  
Number 6 was a challenging hole. It had no fairway. Just a tee box, a big pond, and a green. OK to be fair, the green had a 10 yard finge, but I didn't notice. I only noticed that there was a lot of water, and the tee shot was 169 yards. Norm noticed too. He said, "This is tough. I don't have a club that does 169." Tough? Carma offered no compassion. She said, "Norm, why don't you use the club that does 170?"  
  
I guess that's what 40 years of marriage will get you. Good counsel from your wife.\[fbcomments\]
