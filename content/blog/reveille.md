This morning, I got up at 5:20 am, then went downstairs to practice jazz improv for an hour at the piano.   I then moved into hunter-gatherer mode, and walked a mile to Maverik to get a quart of milk for the morning cereal.   On the way home at 7:30 I heard:

**Reveille!**

Yes, Reveille was playing on the huge loudspeakers of Hill Air Force Base - two miles away.  What a sweet sound, from a distance!   Now the distance is not just two miles.  Also the distance from that place is one year, since one year ago I left my half-time work at HAFB to become the full-time piano technician.   I like hearing Reveille from that distance.

It is a distance of one year with no regrets.  Just a more centered and joy-filled life.\[fbcomments\]
