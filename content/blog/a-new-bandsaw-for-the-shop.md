I said I'd buy it, if it ever went on sale.  I guess someone at Woodcraft heard me.    It came home with me last night and was assembled and adjusted this morning.

The saw has a 13" resaw capability, which will be a great additional capability in the shop.

It's going to be super for piano pinblock work.

Bye Bye Craftsman bandsaw!\[fbcomments\]
