I've spent the day with thoughts of Dad. He shared freely with the people of his life from 1913 to 2001. As I reflect, I regret not writing more about his life. Sometimes, I just don't know how to write the story. But the vignettes are there, and each of these photos have their story. While thinking about Dad, I looked to see exactly what I had written. It's a good start.
