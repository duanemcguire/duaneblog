Bebop enjoys the sights and smells of our walk, but she is also alert to threats. We got started a half hour late this morning, and she heard something new when we approached the first intersection. We heard a small dog barking behind a tall fence across the street. She was all over me for protection, which was a bit uncharacteristic. Usually she can handle a little bark like that. I thought she was just tired, so I said "OK, let's go home".

We went home, but kept right on walking past, and did our usual park tour from the reverse direction. Funny little dog. Everything was just great, she says.
