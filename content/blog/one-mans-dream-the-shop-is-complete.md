I posted photos of the foundation pour 18 months ago. In the last month, I've made a pretty complete transition from working ON the shop to working IN the shop ... but ever since framing was complete the shop equipment was in. So I've been tripping over things for quite a while.

I won't say its done, because it probably never will be. But after finishing a project and getting ready to start a new one, it was pretty clean so I thought I'd share photos.

The sweetest part to me, right now, is the radiant floor heat. I did the final plumbing two weeks ago and fired up the heating unit (80 gallon 75,000 btu water heater in the attic). Temperatures outside have been in the teens. The shop floor has been a constant 73 degrees. Hmmmm. Nice. After Christmas I worked on a project with my daughter, Erin, who was in town for the holiday. I smiled when I saw that she'd kicked off her shoes and was standing in stocking feet while applying finish to the work.

It was really none to soon. Most of the last two weeks have been "Red" pollution days along the Wasatch Front, and wood burning has been prohibited. (I guess it wouldn't have stopped me from burning a good hot fire in the woodstove, but I really don't want to be a part of the problem.)

A slideshow of the shop is here: [Slide show on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanemcguire/sets/72157622963614051/show/)

If you mouse over the show, you will find a "STOP" button in the lower left, which will allow you to progress at your own rate. If you click on the center of the photo a description will be displayed.
