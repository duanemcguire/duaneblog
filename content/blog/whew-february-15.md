Each year, my quartet, [Sound Accord](http://www.soundaccord.com), delivers singing Valentines. It's always a joy! This year since Valentines Day was Saturday, we sang on both Friday and Saturday. We delivered songs to 21 sweethearts on Friday and to 11 on Saturday. It was two days of tears, laughter, and kisses. What a love fest! We sang for teenage sweethearts and for octogenarian sweethearts. We sang before hundreds, and to just one. Each of the 32 events was unique, but each was a clear expression of love. I just plain love being in the middle of it.
