In September, I posted here observations about a barn in Menlo, and the thoughts it spurred in me. Mostly it reminded me that my woodworking and construction projects of a lifetime have been on a small scale and it got me to thinking that I need to jump out and do some larger projects. As the thought progressed, somehow I moved into thinking about timber frame construction as a mode for the the project. Timber frame construction is traditional post and beam construction in which all joints are crafted of wood and joined with hardwood pegs. As the thought progressed, I realized that the project would follow this path:

1. Buy a portable saw mill
2. Buy some logs
3. Make some lumber
4. Build the frame
5. Erect the building

Quite non-traditional and very exciting.

Yesterday I attended the Log and Timber Framing Expo in Sandy, UT. I came away with some valuable contacts and information. Represented at the show were two small firms from the region:

- [Barn Owl Timberframes](http://www.barnowltimberframes.com)
- [Wind River Timberframes](http://www.windriver-timberframes.com)

Chuck Brainerd and Dale Covington (Barn Owl) and Alan Bernholtz (Wind River) generously shared their thoughts and enthusiasms for the art of the timberframe. Chuck has built an impressive home for himself in Utah from a barn he salvaged in the midwest. Alan has completed many masterful homes, and his new [workshop](http://www.windriver-timberframes.com/shop.html) is a beauty in itself. I can't expect to build anything of that scale, but it is an inspiration.
