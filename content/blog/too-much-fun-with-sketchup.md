I've refined the design of the tablesaw outfeed table to include details for the router table and jig storage. Some of the space will remain as cubby holes. Other space will be drawers.

Sketchup really helps! [![Outfeed table3](/images/Outfeed-table3.jpg)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Outfeed-table3.jpg)
