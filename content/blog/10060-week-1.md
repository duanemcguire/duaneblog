I declared I'll ride 100 miles on my 60th birthday. I've got just 217 days to prepare!

Yesterday I rode 30 miles - a bit much - on the Denver & Rio Grande Rail Trail. The ride was from Clinton to Farmington and back. I rode more than I should have, because I was curious whether the trail had finally been extend to connect with the Legacy Parkway Trail. Indeed it has! I'm very fortunate to have such a trail just a half mile from the house. That makes about 30 miles of connected trail (and 60 miles round trip). I should get to the sixty mile ride before the snow flies!

Here's yesterday's 30 mile ride:
