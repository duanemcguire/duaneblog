We're gearing up for deck building this summer.   Sketchup has been invaluable as a design tool.  Notes:

- Detached shade structure is sized for optimal shade through out the seasons
- Shading material is planned to be cloth supported between the joists, with flexibility for rolling back
- Shade structure is to be steel because of the large spans
- Decking is to be hardwood for durability and beauty
- Hot tub?  May be an item for 2015.
