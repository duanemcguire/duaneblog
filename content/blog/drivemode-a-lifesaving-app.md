Hello.  I'm Duane, and I am a smartphone user who drives a car.

So far as I know, there is not a 12-step program for folks like us, but there is a great app!

I've been using [Drivemode for Android](http://drivemode.com), and it enforces good habits for me.   It is feature rich, and here's how I use it:

1) My cars activate Drivemode via bluetooth when  I start the car.

2) I am appointment driven, and as soon as I start up,  a single tap will initiate navigation to my next appointment!  Marvelous!   Just what I've needed for a long time.

3) I've set incoming calls to go to voicemail immediately and the caller gets a text saying I'm driving.  Wonderful.   They know I'm operating safely, and I implicitly encourage them to do the same.

4) I'm never tempted to look at an incoming message from SMS or Messenger.   Drivemode just reads me the message.  Cool.

  
There are many more features.   Check it out:  [Drivemode.com](http://drivemode.com).  Be safe!
