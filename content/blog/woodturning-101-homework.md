Admitting my amateur status, woodturning is new to me! I'm going forward boldly, and I can see that I'll need to be self-aware concerning addictive activities.

Tuesday a drive spur arrived in the mail. More accessories are on the way. Tuesday I took hold of the dull lathe tools I acquired with the lathe, and attempted some turning. It wasn't very satisfying!

Tonight I spent a few minutes sharpening the gouge and skew and I transformed a 4x4 into a very satisfying enigma. The lathe runs smoothly, and in my ignorance I don't know what else I'd ask for! (Unless one of you wants to come over and help me design and build an effective dust collection port for the lathe)
