My dive into digital recording and production started in December with a gift of Ableton LIve! from my son, Ryan McGuire. While he was visiting at Christmas we recorded an earlier release of "Ashokan Farewell" based on my recording with a Yamaha CP33 stage piano. That was a good starting point, but didn't quite satisfy.

The Steinway A3 I've been enjoying since 2017

The introduction to digital recording took me down another path in January, as I wanted to record digitally from my Steinway grand. With that I could express my music with the instrument I love to play. Thus I purchased and installed QRS PNOscan system for recording. With this system I recorded the following performance of "Ashokan Farewell". Ryan rendered it with a PianoTeq 6 Steinway D digital model.

This has been such a satisfying experience! I so appreciate Ryan's gift of a digital recording system. It has been a joy to collaborate with him. I am also pleased to have preserved this performance. I listen to it today, months after the production, and, with pride, I find it to be remarkable, professional, and refined.
