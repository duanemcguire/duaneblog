My doctor encouraged me to join a gym.  Our discussion about my  fitness revealed that I bicycle many miles in good weather, but become a couch potato in the winter.   He told me that with my summer program, I was cycling more than necessary, but hibernating was defeating the summer program!  He also informed me that cost was NO OBJECT.   The "silver sneakers" program of Medicare would pay for it.  Well, I'll be!  I had no idea.

Then [Vasa Fitness](https://vasafitness.com/location/clinton/) sent me a beautiful, oversized postcard announcing their new gym nearing completion a couple miles from home.  I'm not a gym guy, so I could have ignored it.   But the postcard had a picture of their 25 meter lap pool, and I was all in!

[![](/images/pool.resized-300x200.jpg)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pool.resized.jpg)Two weeks later (no sense rushing into this) I'd collected new gym shoes, shorts, new swim trunks, a gym bag, and a nifty combination lock for the locker at the gym.   I was ready.   So today I got courageous (helped by some hand-holding with Terri) and went to the gym.   I was set to enjoy that lap pool!

Being conscientious, after getting the swim trunks on, I trudged off to the showers for the required pre-swim shower.   I stepped in and realized I still had my glasses on!   Really!  Who swims with glasses.  I'd need to go back and stow them in the locker.  No kidding.  What a gym newbie, dunce I had been.  And then ... I had a superior senior thought!   If I stow those glasses,   I won't be able to read the dial on that combination lock!    I could see the scene before me:   "Excuse me, young man!   Could you open my locker for me?   I could tell you the combination!"

What a great brain!  Awkward Senior Moment Averted!
