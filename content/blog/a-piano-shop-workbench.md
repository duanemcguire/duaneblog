My bargain shopping wife found a large "workbench" -- a collection of solid cabinets mounted on an ugly 2x8 base and with a beat-up top. We repurposed all into a remarkably functional bench for the piano shop. Thank you Terri! Yet to come are some new drawers where there are now cubbies and a slideout for a printer.

A major bit of sweetness for the shop are two storage bays below the new top which will accept a grand action. That's a real convenience and a new efficiency in the shop.[![Workbench for the piano shop](/images/2018-08-21-05.48.36-1024x768.jpg)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-08-21-05.48.36.jpg)

Here's a view of the bench with it put to use: [![Piano Shop Workbench](/images/2018-08-24-12.06.58-1024x768.jpg)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-08-24-12.06.58.jpg)

The old bench was acquired from the old Ephrata, Washington High School when it was demolished in the 1980s. I sold it to a happy buyer.Â  It was nice to see it go the a "good garage", after serving me for so many years.
