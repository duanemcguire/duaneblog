Music has always been a huge part of my life, but for the most part I've done my programming work in silence. My rationale has been that music distracts me.  
  
Recently, I stumbled across the online music service Rhapsody, from real.com, and I'm a changed man. I continually listen to piano jazz while working, and I love it.  
  
It is still true that if I listen to vocals, I do get distracted. But the piano jazz is great. Rhapsody has hundreds of tunes of Marian McPartland, and I can listen to her play all day.
