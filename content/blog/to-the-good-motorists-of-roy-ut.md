I would like to thank the good motorists of Roy, for a pleasant morning.   I rode the Denver and Rio Grand rail trail from Clinton to West Haven through Roy at the morning rush.  At each of the half-dozen road crossings in Roy, motorists readily stopped to allow me to cross safely!  I appreciate your good driving manners and safety attitude.

Perhaps you could train the drivers on 300 N in Clearfield at the Burton Street crossing.  They could use some of your good nature.
