As Terri and I were enjoying another of her fine meals on the deck, we talked about how self-isolation has changed our daily lives. Terri was pleased to say that she is quite content with staying home: tending to her garden, caring for Bebop, and being with me more. I loved hearing that she is the happiest she has been since retirement.

The next morning, while listening to [KCSM (my favorite streaming jazz station),](https://kcsm.org/) I heard the song, Let's Eat Home, for the first time. Rosemary Clooney said in song what Terri was saying at lunch!

Enjoy the song and your life where it is.
