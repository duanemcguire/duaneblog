I had once dreamed of building a timber-framed woodshop, but time and locale prevent it. Design for a residential class framed shop are complete, and plans have been submitted for building permit approval. Yes, this will be my largest building project to date! Features:

- 30X28 work space
- 14X28 storage space
- Lots of south window light
- Exterior complements existing house
- [Radiant floor heat](http://www.radiantec.com/systems-sources/closed-system.php)
- dust collection system
- 11' ceiling height
- Usable attic space above
