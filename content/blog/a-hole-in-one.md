I've been knocking those little white balls around for seven years. And this evening it finally happened.  A hole in one!

But no one was there.  Not a witness to behold the event. So now I can finally answer the question: If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Surprisingly, NO.

It looked beautiful as it was sailing toward its target.  I saw it roll up on the green but then it rolled out of view. As I walked to the green, I thought, "well there must be a little ridge there at the front".  As I got closer I still saw no ball on the green.  I was silent.   I walked up to the flag.  There was my Callaway resting at the back of the hole.Â  A beautiful sight honored in silence.
