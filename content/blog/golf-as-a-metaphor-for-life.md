Recently, I've been reading [The Inner Game of Golf by W. Timothy Gallewey](http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0679457607-0). It has spurred some interesting thoughts on life and golf. The reading spawned the following formula, which I created to express my golf game:  
  
W = P1 - P2  
  
where:  
W is "What Matters"  
P1 is Performance  
P2 is Potential  
  
Thus in golf, and I will assert in all of life, what matters is the difference between our performance and our potential. Right now, given the instruction and basic skills I've acquired in golfing, I believe that my potential is "9" that is in playing 9 holes my potential is to be 9 over par. My performance is not that good! As example, this morning, my performance was 13 over par. Reduced to formula:  
  
W = P1 - P2  
W = 13 - 9 = 4  
  
So what mattered in my game was 4 strokes. I failed to reach my potential by 4 strokes. When looking back over the game, I can also identify exactly which strokes they were. The score card reveals that quite handily. They were on holes that were worse than 2 over par, obviously.  
  
What is my potential? That is a question that deserves consideration. Because the definition reveals what is important (W = P1 - P2). It should be clear that right now my potential is not equal to that of Tiger Woods. To think so is to be a fool, because the difference between my performance and Tiger Wood's performance is **not** what matters. What matters is the difference between **my** performance and **my** potential. As my skill set improves, so will my potential. But for now, I'll define my potential as a 9. 
  
**Golf as a Life Metaphor**  
Applying the formula W = P1 - P2 to other situations also seems intuitively to be appropriate. To answer the question: "What matters in my marital relationship?", for instance:  
  
W = P1 - P2  
  
While this evaluation is certainly more subjective than the golfing example, I believe that introspection will reveal the answer. For instance lets score some attributes of a loving relationship. In a loving relationship, I will demonstrate (among others) the following behaviors:  
  
\- Attentiveness to my partner  
\- Honest communications  
\- Faithfulness  
\- Championing her causes  
  
Further, on an arbitrary scale of 0-10, let us say that my potential is 10 in each of these categories. Upon introspection, I may find that my performance is  
  
Attentiveness - 8  
Honest communications - 10  
Faithfulness - 10  
Championing her causes - 7  
  
Then what matters (in maintaining and enhancing the relationship based on these attributes) is 40 - (8 + 10 + 10 + 7 ) = 5. 
  
  
There are at least 5 things I can work on to be a better performer in this area. My priority for improvement would be "Championing her causes" and "Attentiveness".  
  
Becoming a bogey golfer might be easier, but both goals are worthy, and paying attention to "what matters" is always important!
