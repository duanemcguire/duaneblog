Well, the door is hung, and winter can come. I just need to do the weather stripping, and we really are ready.

Next up is the gas line for the radiant floor heat. I'm digging the trench for the gas line right now. Should have the gas supply done in a couple of weeks. Then we can do the 4-way inspection and start installing insulation. After the door was up -- even without insulation -- I noticed the building was warmer than the garage. The south windows are providing good solar gain.
