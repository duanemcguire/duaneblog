![Plain City UT Barn at Sunrise](/images/plainCityBarn.jpg)  
This photograph was a "team effort". I was the driver. My daughter, Erin, was the photographer. In my youth, I enjoyed photography, and apparently the genes have successfully transferred. Erin visited for the holiday week, and brought her new high-end digital SLR camera. It was my suggestion that we go out to photograph some of Utah's vanishing agricultural landscape. I've had the project in mind for some time. We had a great time and took lots of pictures. The photo above is the masterpiece of the week. We visited the site first on Tuesday, then decided to return Wednesday at sunrise for this shot.

Vanishing landscape? This particular barn is across the street from a new subdivision.
