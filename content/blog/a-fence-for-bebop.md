Quarantine Project: the Bebop fence. For years, it has been known, "You can't have a dog. We don't have an enclosed back yard." Well the dog arrived, and the fence is now complete. This was a challenging project, from a design perspective: The fenced area shown was the pathway for driving trucks and trailers into the backyard for projects. Hence two five-foot sections and a central post are removable for access. It was also challenging because my body rebels a bit for all the up and down work. But after two weeks, this two-day project is complete. Terri has volunteered to stain it. Thanks!
