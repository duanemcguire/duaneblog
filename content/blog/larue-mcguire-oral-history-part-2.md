My Mom, LaRue Dorothy Henkel McGuire was born on October 26,  1916.  She lived a remarkable life of 98 years.  Two days ago, we noted the day that would have been her 100th birthday, with memories, photos and stories.

I shared my [blog entry of 2010](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/2010/11/28/moms-early-life/), which included a transcription of an oral history Mom shared.   At the time, I was planning to transcribe a second recording.   But I never got "around to it".   That recording has been in storage and waiting for six years.

On this birthday, the recording needs to be shared with family!    Here it is:
