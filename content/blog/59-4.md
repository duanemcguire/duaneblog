excrpt: A number of years ago, I read a health article which suggested that the decade of the 50's was the last chance for people to "get in shape!"

**Whereas:** 1) I've come to the certain knowledge that in just a few weeks I'll reach the age of 59.5! No big deal except that it is an age canonized in IRS regs -- somehow related to IRA and 401k distributions. I don't need to get into that because my accounts amounted to little a few months ago and even less today!

2) Perhaps more auspicious is the signal event of 60.0 in a few short months.

3) A number of years ago, I read a health article which suggested that the decade of the 50's was the last chance for people to "get in shape!" At least statistically, folks who are not in shape on their 60th birthday, are more prone to health declines in their 60's and 70's. I took that to heart. I took off 60 pounds. I rode the bike. Even rode 100 miles in the Salt Lake Century. That year, I rode the bike more than 3000 miles. But I haven't been so kind to my body these past 3 years. 30 pounds are back and I've ridden less than 300 miles all year.

**Therefore:** I proclaim that on April 1, 2012 -- the 60th anniversary of my birth -- I will ride the bicycle 100 miles.

Who wants to join me?

**PS** I'd better get to training!
