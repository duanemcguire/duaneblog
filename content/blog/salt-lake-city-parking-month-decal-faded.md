## Parking Enforcement Gone Beserk!

**Alert: Avoid Salt Lake City**

While enjoying some laughs at Wise Guys Comedy Club in Salt Lake,  more "humor" awaited me on the windshield of my car!  I was cited for "Month Decal Faded".   What???

That's right.  It seems that the Utah DMV has recently been issuing license plate decals that fade to the point they are unreadable.   And, Salt Lake City, seizing on the opportunity is issuing citations to car owners.  Oops! Come on folks, this is ridiculous. This does not pass the Ho Ho test.

No I'm not alone.  Have a look at this [article in the Salt Lake Tribune](http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/54306078-90/lake-salt-billings-rolly.html.csp).

Here's my very calm email to the folks at Salt Lake City Parking Enforcement.  Do you think they'll respond?

I received a citation while spending money in Salt Lake City this evening for "Month Decal Faded".  Yes.  It is faded.  I didn't know that was a problem.  The registration is valid, and the month of expiration is discernible.   I've attached a photo of the plate.

Please rescind this violation notice.  Really, it cannot pass a common sense test.
