When the neighbors built a white vinyl fence along the north property line a triangle of land was mostly fenced off and of little value for gardening.  When I built the shop, I thought that space would be good for storing trailers.   With the help of a fence along the property, I took the initiative to build a fence and gate.   Given how time gets away, I actually got a bid from a contractor to put in a white vinyl fence with a 10-foot gate.   When I saw the bid of $1500, I immediately re-thought the process.    I thought I could build something pretty nice for less money.   Given the price of high grade cedar, it wasn't cheap but it wasn't $1500.

Here's the results of my efforts: [![Garden Gate](/images/8753013793_333e818c47.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanemcguire/8753013793/ "Garden Gate by Duane McGuire, on Flickr")
