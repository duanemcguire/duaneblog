When I got up yesterday, I decided to encourage spring a bit by shaving off my beard. It worked! Yesterday afternoon the sun came out and snow began to melt. It was in the mid-40's when I got home at 4. I installed the mesh seat that Terri repaired in November. I pumped the tires up to 90 PSI and I got on my bike and went for a ride! I rode like the wind. Well, not quite. The bike wanted to go fast, but my body didn't. 2.5 miles, and I was well ... I was pooped. 3 months of no riding just is not a good training program. But I sure felt alive afterward! Clean air and ice-free roads are coming soon. Let's ride!
