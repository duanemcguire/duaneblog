Good grief.

I accidentally deleted the previous post, thinking I was deleting a comment. Where is my backup? Well ... I didn't contact my webhost.

I copied and pasted from the cached version that Google had, then updated the post date using mysql.

Here's the google search I used to find the item: site:blog.duanemcguire.com sketchup

Google seems to know just about everything.\[fbcomments\]
