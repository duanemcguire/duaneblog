The Kraus House, in St. Louis, is a Frank Lloyd Wright home built in the 1950-1960's. It is much more modern than other homes I've toured, more on the lines of Taliesin West in Phoenix. It seemed like something that would be featured as an avant-garde home in the 1950's in Life magazine. This usonian home has many FLW touches, from Cyprus wood to endless geometry. Only one short wall in the house meets another at a 90 degree angle; rooms, furniture, drawers, lights, beds, walls, and more are primarily parallelograms, trapezoids, or hexagons. Lovely!
