Yesterday I did tell her, "Bebop, I think you're going to have to get a job!"

I was sitting at my desk, either working or wasting time (who knows). In the background I could hear Bebop's satisfied chewing on a chew toy. But given time, the parenting skill of "eyes in the back of the head" came into play. I realized that satisfying chew didn't really sound like any one of her dozens of "chew toys".

No indeed. It was my best pair of progressive bifocals that she had cleverly plucked from the edge of my desk.

Not a chew toy!  

A few seconds of evaluation showed me that in addition to distorting and re-decorating the frames, my sweet dog had also chewed into the lens coatings. I know that I paid about $500 for those glasses in 2018, so Bebop heard some things she hasn't heard before. I went so far as to say:

"Bad Dog!"

and

"Bebop, I think you're going to have to get a job."

You see she was still working off the $15.99 from her allowance for the corded headset of my phone.

Bebop bought these from her future allowance on June 2.

I went downstairs to tell Terri, Bebop's Mom and reliable advocate, the entire story. As I described the event, focusing on "bad dog" and "get a job", Bebop looked from one of us to the other, with tail between her legs. Yes, she knew she was in serious trouble. We had more discussions about "this is yours, but THIS is mine."

Later in the day, in discussion with the optical department of Utah Eye Centers, I found to everyone's relief that the insurance/warranty that I had purchased with the glasses would cover 100% of replacement. Even for puppy destruction. Whew. That was a huge relief for Bebop.

Today, she has had a very relaxing day, knowing that she would not need to join the workforce. Indeed she will maintain her status here of favored one. Much loved and pampered. The education of Bebop continues.

Bebop relaxes, confident of her honored status.
