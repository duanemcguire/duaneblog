The past few days, the woodshop has been put to work on a project that is not a piano!    In December we installed new hardwood flooring and planned that we would fabricate baseboard molding on our own.   I favored a lighter contrasting wood, and my creative wife suggested a laminated baseboard with a walnut detail.    I endorsed her idea despite the extra labor.   I'm going to like it!

Here's the flooring as completed in December:   [![20151225_184524](/images/20151225_184524.jpg)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/20151225_184524.jpg)

Here's the baseboard in process in the shop today:

It's put together with poplar and walnut.   With exposure to light, the poplar will darken.   I'm looking forward to seeing it with some polyurethane finish.
