My mother taught me how to cook. Three rules apply here:

- If you have leftovers, you can make something good out of it.
- If you use good ingredients, it will be good.
- Custard is good.

This does call to mind hundreds and hundreds of pounds of government surplus rice delivered to Raymond High School when Mom was the head cook there.  She said,

> "I just couldn't cook enough rice.  And those kids didn't like it much, either. Then one day I was making mashed potatoes and I thought, 'What difference would it make if I put a few pounds of cooked rice in that?'. You know, no one knew the difference, and they were pretty good mashed potatoes. I sure got rid of that rice."
