In about 1942, my Dad, Harvey McGuire built a house with Grandpa Henkel. That house became a home for the family that Harvey and LaRue McGuire created. It will always be remembered as a place of love and stability. It was the McGuire Family home for sixty-six years.  Here are some of the images of the place as we remember.

At age 92, as Mom made a transition to a retirement apartment, she sold the house.  Over the past 10 years another family came to love that same home.  A few days ago, they offered the home for sale again.   We were delighted at what the house had become!

Next Chapter?

Postscript July, 2020

Of course, the next chapter was that Carol bought the house! It is much more than a house. It is part of the family, and we all enjoy it. I couldn’t resist buying the adjacent lots to complete the “McGuire Estate”. These lots were my childhood “playground”, also known as “the woods”, where my treehouse was built.
