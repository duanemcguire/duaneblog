[Palo Duro Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Duro_Canyon), south of Amarillo, Texas, is not the Grand Canyon, but it certainly is grand! Our campground was about 9 miles out into the valley of the canyon. Lots of nice sights, sun, rain, and stars. The visitor's center had a well-done naturalist, archaeology, and CCC history display.
