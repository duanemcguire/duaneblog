When I got back to the piano a few months ago, after a 15+ year absence, I didn't know what would happen. Ooo boy! A lot has happened. I have practiced with abandon, found a great teacher -- Rebecca Wren of Ford Piano Studio -- and things really are happening! The joy of it is that I find I can perform at a level which was not a part of me 15 years ago. What a fine feeling.

For the past two months I've been working on learning a piece recorded by [Marian McPartland](http://www.npr.org/programs/pianojazz/) many years ago. The piece is her interpretation of "If You Could See Me Now". I am working from the transcriptions of Don Sickler and John Oddo: "The Artistry Marian McPartland" (c 1985) I purchased my copy of this book on eBay. [Amazon also lists it.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0898984157/002-7117281-9755207).

When first approached two months ago, I thought the first measure of page 48 was going to be out of reach. Today, well ... I'm just so happy with it! ![1st measure of page 48](/images/McPartlandp48.gif)

For me, it's pure magic!
