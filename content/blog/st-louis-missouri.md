St. Louis is a surprising place. The city museum has a rooftop ferris wheel and is filled with treehouses. The Gateway Arch does not appear very large, at first, but that is an illusion. When you are standing next to it or are looking out the observation windows, it's majestic size is revealed. It is the world's tallest arch, the tallest man-made monument in the western hemisphere, and the world's largest stainless steel structure. We rode to the top in funky 60's capsules. It was quite an experience! The old courthouse, where the Dred Scott freedom petition was first intoduced, serves as a gateway to the Arch.
