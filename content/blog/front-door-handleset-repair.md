Yesterday I got an oops text from my wife:

[![](/images/Screenshot-from-2019-11-07-12-08-32.png)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-07-12-08-32.png)[![](/images/2019-11-07-11.54.27.rotated-225x300.jpg)](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-07-11.54.27.rotated.jpg)

 

I recognized immediately:

- These handlesets are expensive.
- I'm a woodworker, not a metalworker.
- But I fix stuff.

So despite being unqualified, I tore into it this morning.

There's not much material around the bore, and one side had broken out.\[/caption\]

I knew that I had some solder recommended for work with disparate metals and pot metal castings in particular.   It's a solder that melts at a low temperature (around 400 degrees Fahrenheit, I believe), and can be worked with a heat gun.   Bingo.   I had some stuff that might work.

It works.   Ask me about it a year from now!  I think it will still be good (unfounded confidence of a woodworker).

Here's the material I used, soldering with a heat gun:
