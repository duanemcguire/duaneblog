The building falling down was a chicken house. In about the 30's there were a lot of that style built. I do not know what they build now. About that time there were a lot of chicken farmers in the Rochester area. Something else about Frances: it was a stop over for some of the railroad workers, where they put water in their engines and many times hooked on another engine to make it over Pluvius. Mrs. Christiensen,(Gladys Spurrell's mother) cooked for the men and had rooms for them to stay in. The old house that Ronnie lived in at the foot of Pluvius was another stop for the railroad men.
