I recently took the time to re-learn Sketchup. I'm still inefficient with it, but its capability for joining conceptual drawing with accurate scaling is awesome. I really love it! Though I've played with it a number of times in the past, I think it's finally in my toolbox.

Here's the outfeed table I spent time designing last night. The over-hang on the right provides clearance for dust collection piping on table saw. Still coming in the design:

- router table inset
- storage for router and tablesaw accessories
