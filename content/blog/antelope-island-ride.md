It was a beautiful afternoon. Is it the last spurt of Summer? At 85 degrees, I think maybe so. I don't ride out to Antelope Island often, just because it burns me that the State Park wants $3 for a bicycle and rider. Oh well, I still wanted to go. This is today's ride, and a shot on the island taken with my phone.

This is today's view looking north from the north of the island. It seems to capture the landscape's ethereal nature.

The numbers from the ride:

- 29 miles round trip
- 1 horsefly bite. Those creatures are vicious! While riding at 15 mph, they'd pace me looking for an opportunity.
- 9 antelope! Grazing at the north end of the island
- Thousands of seabirds! Gulls, terns, sand pipers
- 1 butterfly
- Millions of bugs
- 6 bicyclists
- 4 other people outside their cars!
