I'm looking for like minded adult piano students in the Ogden area who would like some informal performance opportunities. Perhaps monthly get togethers in the homes of members of our "group". On a more formal basis, an example of this is the Adult Music Student Forum of the Washington DC area ([http://www.amsfperform.org/](http://www.amsfperform.org/)) I would like more experience performing for others than I get at my teacher's recitals and playing for friends (they say they enjoy it, though!)

Is there a group in this area like I describe? Or can we form one?
