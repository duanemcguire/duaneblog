Hibernation? Death? Disaster? None of the above. Distraction.

Oh yes, I've been distracted. Following an interesting conversation with Terri, my wife, in October, we decided to shop for a suburban home that had a large shop to accomodate my woodworking and piano rebuilding activities. Working out of a storage unit was showing itself to be unfriendly to us both.

So we bought a house with room to build a shop and we've been busy with moving and updating the place at Pleasant View. It's been hard to leave our beautiful condo on the golf course, but we are both enjoying being close to work. In the summer I expect to be enjoying a new shop!
