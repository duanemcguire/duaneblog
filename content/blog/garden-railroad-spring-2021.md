excrpt: Spring has sprung, and it's time to get working on the railroad!

Since the post of last August, some earth moving happened for the garden railroad.   In October, I got 10 yards of fill dirt dumped in the driveway to make the earthen fill of the railroad.   That gave me the opportunity to rent a skidsteer and move some dirt.  I'm not a skilled operator, but I got job done and had some fun for the cost of a daily rental.

This is where the project is today.  I've placed a few more blocks, and Terri has contracted with 10 year-old Ryder for weed control on the grade.

Springtime efforts have been in other areas!
