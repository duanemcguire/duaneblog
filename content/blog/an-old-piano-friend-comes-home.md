Sometime around 1959, in Raymond Washington, I had my first piano lesson. It was on this piano: Schilling and Sons #93032!

 Schilling and Sons Upright Piano made in 1926

My mother acquired the piano sometime in the 1940s. My sister Carol, my sister Nadine,  and I all learned to play on the Schilling and Sons. Then in 1972, Mom thought she should have a smaller piano for her dining room. So she bought a spinet piano, and as part of the purchase, she arranged free delivery of the Schilling and Sons from Raymond to Carol's new home in Vancouver, Washington.  Carol's three girls: Angela, Heather, and Tiffany all learned to play on this piano too.  

In 2008, at the age of 91, Mom left the Raymond home to live in a senior apartment near Carol's home in Vancouver. Carol selflessly provided near daily care and support during Mom's time there. In 2011, with gratitude (and a bit of showmanship), I gave Carol a modern baby grand piano for her birthday. I made the surprise piano delivery, from Utah to Washington, while Carol was on the East Coast for a week. Then I spirited the Schilling and Sons off to Utah to be rebuilt. As it worked out, procrastination and the lack of a plan for that piano meant that it has just been waiting on me these past eight or nine years.  

But then, in 2019, the very house we knew as home in Raymond came on the market, and Carol surprised us all by buying it as a family [vacation home!](http://blog.duanemcguire.com/2019/02/24/a-house/) It was then obvious what the next stopping point for the Schilling and Sons piano would be!   

COVID is upsetting travel plans for this Summer, but today I was pleased to note the completion of work on this family piano.
