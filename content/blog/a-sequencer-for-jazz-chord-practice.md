As I work to develop my "Jazz vocabulary", I wanted an electronic flashcard tool that would help me with ingraining jazz chord patterns at the piano.   Since I didn't find what I wanted, I wrote the app.

Here's what I came up with:   [A Sequencer for Jazz Chord Practice](https://www.mcguirepiano.com/jazzflash)

The app will present chords of your choice in random order or sequenced by intervals of your choice.   Have look.  Let me know what you think.
